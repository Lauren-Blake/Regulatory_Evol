The median width of tissue-DMRs ranged from 189 nt to 531 nt. There was only little variation in width across pairwise tissue comparisons and in different species (Figure S22A).

I am pursuing a graduate degree in data science to understand how the genome sequence influences human specific traits. By integrating data collected from cutting-edge functional genomic techniques, my work provides insight into genome dynamics. This research requires a deep understanding of statistics, computational workflows, and mechanistic biological knowledge. By creating open access workflows, others will be able to build upon my analysis to progress the regulatory genomics field.

Differences in gene regulation between humans and chimpanzees is thought to underlie many phenotypic differences between these groups.

How can local methylation changes act as mechanisms of human evolution? Athma’s paper- “inter-species differences in methylation levels might underlie as much as 12%–18% of differences in gene expression levels between humans and chimpanzees”

Identification of human-specific DNA methylation patternsHernando-Herraez 2015- identified hundreds of regions differentially methylated across humans and non-human primates in peripheral whole blood. 

20% and 36% of human-specific hypo- and hypermethylated DMRs found in blood were detectable in all other tissues tested, including the brain, liver, and placenta. The results of this study begs the question about the contribution of methylation to inter tissue gene expression differences found in humans only, relative to those that are conserved DMRs. 

What was/is the role of methylation differences in creating or maintaining human-specific gene regulation across tissues? Could tell us how did tissue differences within humans evolve? 
Overall, we are interested in how regulatory features in primates across tissues could contribute to gene expression differences. We collected gene expression and DNA methylation genomic data in parallel from frozen human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque primary tissue samples. By using an outgroup to the humans and chimpanzees, such as rhesus macaques, we can look beyond Great Ape evolution.  For example, by looking at differences between humans and the chimpanzee and rhesus group, we may be able to learn about the evolution of human-specific properties. Using matched individuals will have several advantages: Reduce interindividual variation in measurements. Since the individuals have the same genotypes across different tissues, we can ask questions about how different gene expression patterns across tissues manifest.We identified putatively functional tissue-specific gene expression patterns and differentially methylated regions. Finally, we found that intertissue differences in methylation levels might underlie at least 18% of differences in gene expression levels between human tissues and that a higher percentage is explained in conserved intertissue differences than different between humans and chimpsFound that intertissue methylation differences are more likely to underlie conserved intertissue gene expression differences than human-specific intertissue differences. Suggests that methylation may have been important for establishing or maintaining intertissue gene expression differences during early primate evolution. •	Difficulty- many studies comparing multiple primate species only have one tissue (e.g. Wang 2012 in prefrontal cortex, Molaro et al. 2011 in sperm, DIK Martin et al. in neutrophils, Fukuda et al 2013 in peripheral blood leukocytes, Hernando-Herraez et al. 2013 and Hernando-Herraez et al. 2015 in peripheral blood)•	Previous study from our lab- high degree of conservation between tDMRs in humans and chimpanzees, consistent with previous research comparing human and mice tDMRs (Irizarry et al. 2009).
